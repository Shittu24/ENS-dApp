# THE ETHEREUM NAME SERVICE (ENS) SETUP WITH LEARNWEB3DAO SOPHOMORE TRACK

This project demonstrates a process where users can set up an ENS server where they can get the shorthand of their wallet addresses instead of having to copy and paste the long addresses. Any address that is registered with an ENS domain will be able to use this feature

The frontend was built with NextJS that provides a simple user interface to allow users to interact with the contract.


Try running some of the following tasks on the contract (hardhat-tutorial) directory:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

## Getting Started With The Frontend

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
